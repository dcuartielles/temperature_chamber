'sweaty doodle, spongy smudge, \ni crawled up her stairs on my last feet: existential decay into blind crumbs bleeding. \nand she stood there in the open door, awaiting me in her \ncrisp white apron straight from a bath house in budapest, \npure function in the name of health. all smile and caress, she kissed, \nunwavering in her knowledge of what was left alive in the body she held. i\'ll draw you a bath, \nshe resolved, the glow in her eyes transmuted the question into a path \nmy heart sheepishly followed.'
