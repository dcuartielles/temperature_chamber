# Arduino Temperature Chamber

## Description
The goal of the Temperature Chamber is to create a standardised mechanism as well as a benchmark to measure boards against. The chamber is a tool for answering questions like "How long can a board operate at 60Â°C before failure?" It prioritizes accessibility and replicability by using cost-effective, off-the-shelf components.

## Tests 
To send tests from the Python application to be queued and run in the Temperature chamber, the user uploads a json file with meta data for the tests. The meta data consists of:
- Test names as the key for each test.
- An array of chamber sequences, each including keys and values for temperature and duration.
- A path for the sketch that is to be uploaded to the board inside of the chamber.
- A string value of the expected serial output from the board inside of the chamber.

These files are put in designated directories inside of the `tests` directory, alongside directories for sketches that are to be uploaded to the board inside of the chamber for each test configuration.

### File structure for tests
```sh
tests
|-- alphabets
|   |-- alphabet
|   |   `-- alphabet.ino
|   |-- alphabet_mathematical
|   |   `-- alphabet_mathematical.ino
|   `-- alphabet_test.json
```


## Communication protocol examples
The communication protocol is JSON based. Below are examples of JSON payloads to communicate between the Temperature Chamber control board and the Python app.

### Example test sketch
```arduino
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    // Loop through the alphabet
    for (char letter = 'A'; letter <= 'Z'; letter++) {
        Serial.print(letter);
        delay(500);
    }

    // Print a newline after the full alphabet
    Serial.println();
    delay(1000);
}
```
